# indstudy2019
android midterm

project for independent study done in the spring semester of 2019.
our first look into application development, with a focus in android studio - partner was working with swift & iOS,
we collaborated on how we'd implement our ideas, organize code, etc.

the end result was a silly choose-your-own-adventure game based on The Bachelor. there was a time constraint
and it was the second application made w/ android studio so it's bare essentials
